RingFIR Image Embeddings with Milvus is a Python-based workflow that enables efficient storage and similarity search of a large image dataset. The project leverages the CLIP model (clip-ViT-L-14) to generate high-dimensional embeddings for jewelry images hosted on GitHub. These embeddings are stored in a Milvus vector database (Zilliz Cloud), allowing fast and accurate retrieval of visually similar images.

Key features of this project include:

Parallel processing of large image datasets for faster embedding computation.

Secure storage of Milvus connection credentials in Google Drive.

Support for local and remote query images for similarity search.

Vector indexing and search using Milvus, enabling rapid nearest-neighbor retrieval.

Fully Colab-compatible workflow, making it easy to run in the cloud.

This setup is ideal for building image search engines, recommendation systems, or visual search applications for jewelry and other product catalogs.
